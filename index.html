            <p>Dear Mie,</p>
            <p>
                This isn't really a confession. If it were, it would probably go on forever. It's actually the first time I've ever written something like this, and honestly, it might be the last. I’m not even sure where to start, but I’ll do my best.

                If looking into your eyes could somehow send me to hell, I’d still brag to Satan that I got to see heaven without even stepping inside. Your eyes really do feel like heaven to me. The longer I look, the more I fall in love. I think I might actually die of shyness if I saw them in real life. To me, you seem like the most perfect creation, like you don’t have any flaws at all. But then I started to notice that you’re not perfect—and somehow, that made me love you even more. You’re just perfect in your own way.
                
                I love you unconditionally, but I don’t think you could ever feel the same way about me. I’m not hot, or cute, or muscular. I’m just an average guy, but I still love you with everything I’ve got. I always thought about how happy a guy must be to get a “Good morning,” or “Pookie,” or “Good night,” or “I love you” text from you. Even if I can’t be that guy, I’m still thankful to God that I got to know you, to see your smile, and to hear your laugh.
                
                I’ve always wanted it to be you, but I can’t make you choose me. Your life is yours to live, and you deserve someone who can give you everything you want. But even if I’m not that person, I’ll always treasure the time we’ve spent together. When I was at my lowest, even when my parents stopped talking to me, you were there. You understood me, and you didn’t leave. I could never forget you for that. I always want you to be around, even if one day you decide to leave. For now, I’m just really happy to be your friend.
                
                I love you so much that it warms my heart. When I’m with you, I feel this strange, amazing feeling, and when I’m not with you, it actually hurts. I’ve never been the romantic type, but I find myself thinking about you all the time. I love you with all my heart, Mie. I love you so much that I wish you could see yourself the way I see you and understand just how much you mean to me. You’ve made every other girl out there seem less interesting, and I bet you never thought I’d tell you that.
                
                I’m so scared of losing you, more than anything. I hope you’re doing okay. Even if we can’t be together, I still imagine what it would be like if we were.  Even if you stop texting, or even block me, I’ll still love you with all my heart.
